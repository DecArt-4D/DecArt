## Echoes of the Prior: Visualizing the Decay of Machine Memory in 3D Reconstruction

### Abstract
Memory is not merely the storage of data; it is the scaffolding of reality. When biological memory fades, the world does not simply turn black; it loses its semantic coherence. Echoes of the Prior is an interactive installation that attempts to visualize this subjective phenomenology of forgetting. By inducing controlled synaptic decay within a Feed-Forward 3D Reconstruction model, we simulate the erosion of the brain's predictive priors. We position the Neural Network not as a tool for engineering, but as a cognitive proxy - a silicon brain whose structural degeneration offers us a glimpse into the disorienting, poetic, and terrifying experience of losing one's grip on the world. Ultimately, we offer this framework as a catalyst, inviting the wider community to explore the uncharted potential of neuromorphic aesthetics in visualizing the fragility of intelligence.
