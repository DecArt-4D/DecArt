## Echoes of the Prior: Visualizing the Decay of Machine Memory in 3D Reconstruction

### Abstract
In the era of large vision models, 3D reconstruction is no longer a purely geometric calculation but a semantic translation rooted in "priors"—the compressed visual memory of the machine derived from massive historical datasets. This project, Echoes of the Prior, investigates the fragility of this epistemological framework.

Using a modified Gaussian Splatting pipeline conditioned on DinoV3 features, we construct an interactive installation that remediates a single 2D image into a volumetric scene. By introducing controlled perturbations into the feature latent space—simulating a form of "digital dementia"—we disrupt the machine's ability to recall spatial semantics. The resulting artifacts are not mere pixel noise, but "ontological failures": objects dissolve into abstract manifolds as the system loses the concept of form.

This work positions the reconstruction process as a translation between the machine's past experiences (priors) and the viewer's present reality. It reveals that our digital reality is sustained by a delicate web of learned biases, asking: What remains of the world when the machine forgets how to see it?
